=========
Abstract:
=========

1. Convert official PDB to compact form which only contains the necessary ATOM co-ordinate information.
   e.g.,  ./PDB_Tool -i examples/1paz.pdb -r A -o 1pazA.pdb

2. Extract structural features from input PDB file by '-F' option.
   e.g.,  ./PDB_Tool -i examples/1paz.pdb -r A -o 1pazA.pdb -F 3

3. Specify residue range by '-r' option, which could be applied to process SCOP domain.
   e.g.,  ./PDB_Tool -i examples/2c2l.pdb -r A:24-224 -o d2c2la1.pdb



========
Install:
========

1. download the package

git clone --recursive https://github.com/realbigws/PDB_Tool
cd PDB_Tool/

--------------

2. compile

cd source_code/
	make
cd ../

--------------

3. update the package

git submodule foreach --recursive git pull origin master



================
Running example:
================

./PDB_Tool -i examples/1paz.pdb -r A -o 1pazA.pdb

PDB_Tool options:
=================

---------------------------------------
structural features output by -F option
---------------------------------------

(1) AMI (amino acid sequence)
(2) CLE (conformational letter sequence in 17-state, defined according to [Wang & Zheng] )
(3) SSE (secondary structure element sequence in 8-state, defined according to [Kabsch & Sander] )
(4) ACC (relative solvent accessbility value calculated by [Kabsch & Sander], as well as the 3-state defined as [Ma & Wang] )
(5) FEAT (structural features containing AMI,CLE,SSE,ACC,rACC; contact number with CA and CB; and co-ordinate of CA and CB )


feature file example
--------------------
-F 1 to output AMI,CLE,SSE
-F 2 to output ACC and rACC
-F 4 to output FEAT     
           
Note that these output files could be combined, such as 
-F 3 to output AMI,CLE,SSE, and ACC,rACC files
-F 5 to output AMI,CLE,SSE, and FEAT files



----------------------------------
specify residue range by -r option
----------------------------------

symbol explanation:
-------------------
':' for PDB numbering, that the range is selected according to the residue number in the PDB file.
'.' for SEQUENCE numbering, that the range is selected according to sequential order, starting from 1.
'-' to indicate a certain beginning till the end.
'+' to indicate a certain beginning followed by the length range.
'@' to indicate the beginning or the ending of a certain chain.
',' to seperate between two PDB chains.
'!' to select all chains in the structure.
'_' to use the first chain in the structure.


example:   
--------
A:21-179,B.45-@


description:
------------
Two segments from the input structure are selected.                             
For chain A we select from residue 21 to residue 179 according to PDB numbering,
whereas for chain B we select from position 45 to the end in sequential order.  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the range symbol definition above is compatible with SCOP. 
    Then PDB_Tool could be applied to process SCOP domain defined as [Brenner et.al], for instance,

SCOP domain:
    d2c2la1 a.118.8.1 (A:24-224)
range process:
    ./PDB_Tool -i 2c2l.pdb -r A:24-224 -o d2c2la1.pdb
